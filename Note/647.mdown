# 647. Palindromic Substrings

Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in this string.

The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings even they consist of same characters.

## Time Cost

O(n*2)


Tips:
The key point for dp is how to divide subproblem. For this question the subproblem for length l( l<= string length)  whether the left index to  the left index + l -1 is a palindromic string.
